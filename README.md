# “Harmony Student Club- NITR” Internship Program

Hi I made this project as my first assignment in <b>“Harmony Student Club- NITR” Internship Program
</b>.
<br>
I have used <b>TMDb API</b> for build this web site. <b>In this code I removed the API Key. </b>

I have used

<li>HTML
<li>CSS
<li>JavaScript
<br> for complete this assignment.
<br><br>Here's the link to check the my assignment.<br>
<a href="https://lakshithahewagamage.github.io/calculator/"> <img src="https://mightygadget.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Plex.jpg"> </a>
<br>

I made this Movie-list project in dark mode and light mode. as per user's wish he/she can change the mode of calculator.
<br>

There is a rating button, using that button we can choose 3 categories of movies, like ratings above 7.5, ratings in between 5 and 7.5 and also ratings less than 5 .
<br>

and also there are several tags, using those tags we can search related movies.
<br>
in this project I added a search bar also, using search bar we can search movies manually.
